# Volcano Key System Bypasser Scripts

Welcome! This guide will help you set up and use special scripts to bypass volcano key system. These scripts are designed to bypass full volcano key system automatically. This guide is for beginners, so every step is explained simply.

## What is a Userscript?

A userscript is a small program that changes how a website looks or behaves in your browser. You can use them to add new features, change a site's appearance, or automate tasks. To use these scripts, you need a userscript manager. For this guide, we will use Tampermonkey.

## Step 1: Install Tampermonkey

Tampermonkey is a free and popular browser extension that manages your userscripts. It's available for all major web browsers.

First, you need to add the Tampermonkey extension to your browser. Click the link below for your specific browser and follow the instructions to install it.

*   [**Tampermonkey for Chrome**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo)
*   [**Tampermonkey for Firefox**](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/)
*   [**Tampermonkey for Microsoft Edge**](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/tampermonkey/iikmkjmpaadaobahmlepeloendndfphd)

*   [**Tampermonkey for Opera**](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/tampermonkey-beta/)

After installation, you should see a new Tampermonkey icon in your browser's toolbar, usually near the top right corner.

## Step 2: Install the Scripts

Now that you have Tampermonkey installed, you can add the bypasser scripts.

1.  Click on each of the script links below, one by one.
2.  A new tab will open in your browser showing the script's code and information.
3.  Click the **"Install"** button to add the script to Tampermonkey.

That's it! The script is now installed and will run automatically when you visit the relevant websites.
